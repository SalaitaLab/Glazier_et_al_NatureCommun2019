Commented analysis code for Glazier, Brockman, Bartle, Matteyses, Destaing, and Salaita. In revision, 2019. 
Codes are written to be run in sections and not all the way through. Many image analysis codes require user input or selection. 

Codes for MFM are available at https://experiments.springernature.com/articles/10.1038/nmeth.4536


These files work in conjuction with ND Bioformats. https://www.openmicroscopy.org/bio-formats/ This program must be installed and on your MATLAB path for these codes to run. 
You also must have SEM_calc from https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/26508-notboxplot to run these codes.
